The book also explains how Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is used to restore the healthy brain chemistry that allows us to eat mindfully and stop fixating on food. While having read the book is not a prerequisite for working with the App, users who find the App most effective have either read the book or listened to the audio book to understand the neuroscience behind the App.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend using the App for 21 consecutive days, as any rewiring process requires consistent repetition. During each 21-day phase our objectives are to: lessen or eradicate the overwhelming power of food fantasies, build a mindfulness practice, bolster whatever life skill has been identified as most responsible for overeating triggers, and rekindle the activities that help our brain crave dopamine sources other than food.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The App can be used without coaching, however users that are coached are 88% more likely to report quantum improvement after a 21-day focused period.<\/p>\r\n","Help":"<p><strong>About TWB Help<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The App is intended to be used enthusiastically for 21 consecutive days, as that has been shown to be the most effective duration for successful rewiring.&nbsp; The key functions that should be repeated for those 21 days are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) the Commitment statements<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b)&nbsp;&quot;Step 1: Hunger Type&quot; (to manage any occurrence of brain hunger)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>and<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c) Prep for Mindful Eating (before eating anything).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 20+ functions provided to support the needs of the user during her rewiring process.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; (FAQ) webpage, www.thinwomanbrain.com\/FAQ, will answer many questions regarding the rewiring process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we host check-in sessions on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays catering to the US audience, on Wednesdays catering to women in Europe and Africa, and Saturday mornings catering to women in Oceania region, which includes Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp; Other questions regarding App usage are best directed to support@thinwomanbrain.com.<\/p>\r\n","LastLoaded":"2014-12-24 14:28:02"}, {"ScreenName":"Break The Flow","Info":"<p><strong>Break the Flow<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you ever start eating a couple of cookies or start on a bag of potato chips, STOP and leverage this <\/em><strong>Break the Flow<\/strong><em> function.<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability to break the flow -- even after starting down the well-worn&nbsp;path that in the past would have led to eating the entire carton or bag or container of food -- is one of the life skills possessed by individuals who overcome addictive behavior.

The idea of compassionate self-acceptance feels foreign.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let me share the biochemistry of it all.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we experience fear or stress, we generate cortisol. Cortisol is also generated during &quot;famine brain,&quot; as the body is hypervigilant about keeping every ounce of extra fat to avoid &quot;starvation.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, when we feel connected, accepted, bonded to other human beings, we generate oxytocin, the neuromodulator that signals our body that we are &quot;out of danger,&quot; that it&#39;s OK to let the extra fat go. The ability to extend to ourselves the compassion and acceptance that we so beautifully extend to others allows our bodies to generate oxytocin, which in turn supports the body in its release of extra fat.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, that&#39;s the chemistry lesson. Now let&#39;s look at handling a specific instance of &quot;brain hunger.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I first had to ACCEPT the judgmental inner parent who BELIEVED I could meet my objectives only through self-denial, self-control, and deprivation, who believed the only way to achieve weight loss was through &quot;tough love.&quot;&nbsp; What we did not realize until recently is that this harsh inner parent is the mechanism that activates FAMINE BRAIN!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;how&quot; of compassionate self-acceptance begins with paying close attention to the judgmental voices in our heads. We have repeated those judgments so many times that we now deeply identify with them. A voice says, &quot;How can you let yourself get so fat? You&#39;re so worthless. You&#39;re undesirable.&quot;&nbsp; And we never question it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can practice questioning and dismantling the critical judge inside our head. Life becomes more enjoyable when we are no longer controlled by the self-judgments we were taught as children, especially if you were brought up with a &quot;shameful&quot; belief system&nbsp;-- I&#39;m a recovering Catholic! Compassion for ourselves and others grows as we realize we have all received some kind of conditioning.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attend to your inner states and thoughts and learn to cohabitate with them; observe them instead of letting them run your life. When you hear that harsh inner parent saying you haven&#39;t done enough, lovingly remind that voice that you know she thinks that, thank her for the opinion, and tell her you now have a new belief system. When we start with something as simple as this and build on it day by day, it&#39;s surprising how deeply it will change us.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two forces working in our brain. The inner child wants to be nurtured, to be indulged, and to experience pleasure. The harsh inner parent believes that deprivation is the answer. Many of us are far too familiar with the inner parent that exercises self-control in order to endure months of focus with diet after diet. Ironically, this stern, controlling force is exactly what plunges us into a state of perpetual famine brain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we have learned from TCB is that we must acquire the ability to compassionately observe these two forces that are battling inside our brain. We must accept that the inner child can be quiet and well behaved for long periods of time while our controlling inner parent has the upper hand. But when she screams to convince us that if we eat something yummy, we can continue pushing ourselves to work extra hours, or that we deserve the extra fill-in-the-blank to reward ourselves for all of our hard work, we need to invite our <em>loving<\/em> inner parent to step in. Compassionate self-acceptance ushers in our nurturing inner parent, who allows us to observe the desire to overeat and has the wisdom to remind us that what we truly need is a healthier source of dopamine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n","Help":"","LastLoaded":"2014-12-13 09:11:58"}, {"ScreenName":"Customize my TWB APP","Info":"<p><strong>Rewiring Support<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several personal settings that will improve the effectiveness of the rewiring process -- for example, accurately answering the assessment questions, or deciding which life skill you should work on during which phase, or helping you identifying your personal sources of dopamine.

When you eat in a relaxed, mindful state, then you are able to breathe between bites and invest whatever time is needed for a&nbsp;mindful&nbsp;meal.

We also are not dealing with emotional issues caused by others that can trigger responses that we attempt to cover by overeating.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Phase 1, eating alone or with a compatible spouse\/partner is the ideal eating condition, as it allows us to be fully present to the food, the aroma, the texture, and most importantly the subtle change in our palate when our body tells us that it is satiated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we are eating alone in a public place, we sometimes feel self-conscious, and we resort to reading a book or texting, when in fact, these activities divert our attention, and once again they relegate eating to a background experience. We then eat to hide our sense of discomfort and end up eating more food than is necessary for our physical sustenance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prep for Eating at a Social Engagement<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies show that most people eat 30-40% more when eating in a social milieu. &nbsp;The issue that causes overeating in social settings is multi-faceted:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to fit in, and talking about food gives us something to do. It can be a topic of conversation, in fact, even connection: &quot;Have you tried the crab cakes? They&#39;re to die for!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;You made this? Wow, it&#39;s fantastic! I want the recipe.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During Phase 1, it is highly recommended to triple-prep for events where food will be the MAIN focus of the social gathering. Let&#39;s suppose that you are going to &quot;The Best of [Your City]&quot; food tasting. &nbsp;This is an event where scores of restaurants will be serving samples. How can you prepare for such an event?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask yourself exactly what strategy would be most effective for you: 1) identifying the best restaurant and getting your full meal from just this one restaurant, or 2) going with the spirit of the event and sampling from as many booths as you can.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are selecting one restaurant, have a mindful meal. Then, for one solid minute, repeat to yourself that you are physically full and that you are accepting that anything else that you eat is a response to your current neural nets. &nbsp;If you are hanging around with friends who are going to be <em>sampling<\/em><strong>,<\/strong> recognize that you are highly likely to be triggered into overeating. &nbsp;Commit either to leaving at the moment you feel overwhelmed (and are going to start overeating), or to leveraging the App tools.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are participating in the spirit of the event, select 10 restaurants from which you will take <strong><em>small<\/em><\/strong> samples. Prepare to truly swirl, brag about, and make love to each and every one of these samples.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring several small &quot;take home&quot; containers. Remind yourself you are not saying NO!&nbsp; You are saying &quot;I&#39;ll enjoy these when I&#39;m next hungry, when I can truly appreciate how wonderful they taste.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time you feel an overwhelming pull to deviate from your strategy, ask yourself, &quot;What is fueling this desire to overeat?&nbsp;Do I believe that I must capitalize on my investment to get &lsquo;my money&#39;s worth&#39;? Do I believe that this is a rare opportunity to experience these flavors?&quot;&nbsp;Would you be willing to courageously journal on how these beliefs continue to rule your life?&nbsp; How does your naturally thin woman&#39;s brain view these events?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep asking yourself, am I connecting with others? Would I still be eating if I were having a great conversation with someone at this party? Am I using food to hide my social discomfort?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If food is THE main event, then you must have a strategy to deal with triggers that will arise during the event. For example, when on vacation, make plans to take breaks, get out and see the sights, walk\/ride a bike, get to know your destination.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know that during Phase 1 of the rewiring, for women with &quot;severe&quot; YFAS scores, eating with others at a table with large, open platters can be challenging! &nbsp;Plan on taking 2 breaths in between bites if you catch yourself reverting to your old patterns.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your brain still believes that overeating is a pleasure. That makes it extremely difficult to say &quot;I&#39;m satisfied&quot; when there is tasty food right by you, ESPECIALLY when everyone else appears to be enjoying it. Remember that addicts get triggered by just the sight of other addicts indulging in their drug. If your addiction level is high, the mere sight of food will make you salivate as the food fantasies generate dopamine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of sitting at a table full of food, walk around and, again, keep asking yourself, &quot;What are the naturally thin people doing at this party?&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;ll bet you they are primarily dancing or admiring the d&eacute;cor or the view. When food is the most interesting thing to do at a party, it&#39;s time to ... go for a walk. ;-)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prep for Eating with Family<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be aware that at the early stages of your rewiring, eating &quot;family style&quot; can be challenging! &nbsp;Your brain still believes that overeating is a pleasure. It makes it extremely difficult to say &quot;I&#39;m satisfied&quot; when there is tasty food right by you, ESPECIALLY when everyone else appears to be enjoying it. Remember that addicts get triggered by just the sight of other addicts indulging in their drug. If your addiction level is high, the mere sight of food will make you salivate as the food fantasies generate dopamine. Don&#39;t feel ashamed to ask for support. Sitting next to food, even when you already know that you are physically full, will be challenging.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there are family tensions, the peacekeepers in the family typically attempt to hide behind their food. If you are working on your communication skills, you might not be able to express your emotions, and again you may cope by overeating, as that is how we all cope with situations we lack the skills to address.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prep for Eating with Friends<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most restaurant meals last from 90 to 180 minutes. Think about it: three to six times longer than when you eat a meal mindfully by yourself. For most of my adult life I didn&#39;t have the awareness, let alone the courage, to be truthful with myself and admit that I was not engaged. I also did not take responsibility to <em>be<\/em> engaging and to bring interesting topics to the social gathering. When food is the most interesting part of the social gathering, you will be challenged not to overeat. The longer you sit at the table, the more likely you will be to overeat.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you experience that the food has a magnetic pull, ask yourself, &quot;If I were having an interesting conversation, would I still be feeling overwhelmed by the desire to overeat?&quot; Don&#39;t place all of the responsibility of that interesting conversation on others. Can you bring at least three compelling topics that will keep you interested and emotionally engaged?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most human beings model others when eating in groups. Pace yourself with the <em>lightest<\/em> eater of the group.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When eating socially, it is more important than ever that you breathe between bites. Instead of just one breath between bites, take two or three.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are overwhelmed by brain hunger, order something like string beans or edamame, and mindfully chew on those.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Meals on a Vacation<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, is this a bona fide vacation?&nbsp;A time to restore&nbsp;yourself, nurture your soul and experience joy?&nbsp;Or, is it a family vacation?&nbsp;Will it help you revisit funny or loving memories and rekindle meaningful connections?&nbsp;Will you feel nurtured, accepted and understood by those that you share a profound bond with?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is a family vacation, and you are lucky to have a family where you truly feel restored, you&#39;ve won the family lottery. For those for whom &quot;family vacations&quot; need to be followed by psychological therapy, you must understand that you might be subjecting yourself to a roller coaster of emotions that could feel like a machine gun of triggers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awareness is the key. Can you name the memories, behaviors, and feelings that trigger &quot;brain hunger&quot; when you interact with your family?&nbsp;Do you have any clue as to the life skill that would help you effectively deal with these triggers?&nbsp;If not, would you like help addressing these triggers?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is food THE main event of the vacation?&nbsp;Or the means to take breaks?&nbsp;If it is the main event, what can YOU do to make your vacation about new experiences, feeling joy, or rejuvenating and restoring yourself?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get to know your destination before you arrive! Take games that you can share with others, plan activities off the beaten path, and identify locations to take breaks that are not around food or in restaurants.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When eating with others, name the instances when &quot;I&#39;m not engaged&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m upset&quot; or &quot;I&#39;d rather be doing something else.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these will trigger brain hunger. Plan to leverage the App tools, minimally journal, or take breaths to restore inner emotional balance.<\/p>\r\n","Help":"<p>If the statement by the check box is accurate, check it.&nbsp; If you are not sure, leave it blank, click &ldquo;Next&rdquo; twice and record any anxiety, disappointment, or triggers in the Journal box at the bottom of the &ldquo;Mindful Eating&rdquo; page.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n","LastLoaded":"2014-12-13 13:15:12"}, {"ScreenName":"EMDR","Info":"Test EMDR Info message","Help":"Test HELP EMDR message","LastLoaded":"2014-12-29 00:00:00"}, {"ScreenName":"Graphics","Info":"information","Help":"help","LastLoaded":"2014-12-11 23:18:46"}, {"ScreenName":"Journal","Info":"<p>Journaling comes naturally to some people and less so to others.

Additives, especially sugar, stimulate the pleasure center directly, and we cannot discern when we are physically full. These substances promote overeating and counter your ability to recognize physical satiation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sitting down? <\/strong>Means that you ate your entire meal while sitting down.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Focused? <\/strong>Means that you gave 100% of your attention to the eating process. Eating is not a background activity. While you are eating, you are not watching TV, checking or responding to an incoming text, surfing the Internet, or even listening to the radio. 100% of your attention is given to the eating process.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Small bites? <\/strong>Your ability to take small enough quantities of food in each bite that you can savor every speck of flavor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chewed slowly? <\/strong>Chewing your food completely aids your digestion, which means that you are getting more nutrients from a smaller amount of food and hence needing less food to nourish your body.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Breaths between bites? <\/strong>When you shovel in food, and <em>keep<\/em> taking as much food in each bite as you can fit in your mouth, as rapidly as you can get it in there, you are not feeding your physical body; you are feeding the addiction that wants a dopamine fix as quickly as&nbsp;is humanly possible. A food addict can&#39;t take breaths between bites. When you keep shoveling in food without taking breaths between bites, you are feeding the addiction, and there is no opportunity for your physical body to tell you when it has been nourished. This is the most important quality of mindful eating. Taking breaths between bites is the difference between feeding the addiction and nourishing your physical body.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also during breathing that you can check in with your body to discern whether your palate has changed. That&#39;s how your body tells you when your physical hunger has been satiated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pleasurable? <\/strong>Your ability to experience pleasure while savoring each individual bite and eating in a mindful manner.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trusted palate change? <\/strong>This measures your ability to trust when your palate changes (and to get up from the table, or if you&rsquo;re with others, to stop eating).

Each one has a sliding scale from 0 to 100%. These are all required; you must specify a value for each one of these scales.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are all subjective scores, so let me give you some examples of my recommendations:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Level of enthusiasm? Since this is probably the most crucial factor in your successful rewiring process, you need to be sure you&#39;re finding ways to maintain your enthusiasm for the program. If you&#39;re thrilled with the changes you&#39;re experiencing, give yourself a high rating. If you&#39;re absolutely committed to rewiring, but not enthusiastic about all you have to do to get there, you&#39;re probably at about 50%. If you&#39;re under 50%, you should get support from one of the TWB staff or schedule another check-in.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No added sugar, no flavor enhancers? <\/strong>As you know, it&#39;s important to eat whatever your body is craving. However, if your meal had a lot of extra sugar and flavor enhancers, you were directly stimulating the pleasure center, compromising your ability to discern physical satisfaction, so I would give that type of meal a low number.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sitting down? <\/strong>Did you eat half the meal at the kitchen counter before you were able to sit down? I would give that a low number.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Focused? <\/strong>Was the TV on? Did you check email or text while eating?&nbsp;Was your monkey mind worrying about future events or regretting previous decisions? Even blaring music is distracting. Anything that interferes with your ability to give 100% of your focus to your meal would be rated as a low number.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Small bites? <\/strong>Were you able to place small bites in your mouth? Or were you compelled to shovel in as much food as physically possible? If you felt challenged by eating with small bites, then I would rate this as a low number.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chewed slowly? <\/strong>Were you able to place the eating utensil down and chew slowly? If that was challenging for you, I would rate this as a low number.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Breaths between bites? <\/strong>Were you able to take a deep breath between each and every bite? If not, then I would rate that as a low number.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pleasurable? <\/strong>Did you experience pleasure while eating in a mindful manner? At the beginning of this process, those of us with a high addiction level are unable to experience pleasure eating in this manner. When a meal is an attempt to feed the addiction, not our physical bodies, we experience elevated anxiety, and consequently we should rate this as a low number.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make any notes that would be helpful to you in recognizing your challenges or asking how we can help you identify challenges as you adopt your new behaviors.

We also are not dealing with emotional issues caused by others that can trigger responses that we attempt to cover by overeating.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Phase 1, eating alone or with a compatible spouse\/partner is the ideal eating condition, as it allows us to be fully present to the food, the aroma, the texture, and most importantly the subtle change in our palate when our body tells us that it is satiated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we are eating alone in a public place, we sometimes feel self-conscious, and we resort to reading a book or texting, when in fact, these activities divert our attention, and once again they relegate eating to a background experience. We then eat to hide our sense of discomfort and end up eating more food than is necessary for our physical sustenance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prep for Eating at a Social Engagement<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies show that most people eat 30-40% more when eating in a social milieu. &nbsp;The issue that causes overeating in social settings is multi-faceted:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to fit in, and talking about food gives us something to do. It can be a topic of conversation, in fact, even connection: &quot;Have you tried the crab cakes? They&#39;re to die for!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;You made this? Wow, it&#39;s fantastic! I want the recipe.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During Phase 1, it is highly recommended to triple-prep for events where food will be the MAIN focus of the social gathering. Let&#39;s suppose that you are going to &quot;The Best of [Your City]&quot; food tasting. &nbsp;This is an event where scores of restaurants will be serving samples. How can you prepare for such an event?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask yourself exactly what strategy would be most effective for you: 1) identifying the best restaurant and getting your full meal from just this one restaurant, or 2) going with the spirit of the event and sampling from as many booths as you can.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are selecting one restaurant, have a mindful meal. Then, for one solid minute, repeat to yourself that you are physically full and that you are accepting that anything else that you eat is a response to your current neural nets. &nbsp;If you are hanging around with friends who are going to be <em>sampling<\/em><strong>,<\/strong> recognize that you are highly likely to be triggered into overeating. &nbsp;Commit either to leaving at the moment you feel overwhelmed (and are going to start overeating), or to leveraging the App tools.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are participating in the spirit of the event, select 10 restaurants from which you will take <strong><em>small<\/em><\/strong> samples. Prepare to truly swirl, brag about, and make love to each and every one of these samples.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring several small &quot;take home&quot; containers. Remind yourself you are not saying NO!&nbsp; You are saying &quot;I&#39;ll enjoy these when I&#39;m next hungry, when I can truly appreciate how wonderful they taste.&quot;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time you feel an overwhelming pull to deviate from your strategy, ask yourself, &quot;What is fueling this desire to overeat?&nbsp;Do I believe that I must capitalize on my investment to get &lsquo;my money&#39;s worth&#39;? Do I believe that this is a rare opportunity to experience these flavors?&quot;&nbsp;Would you be willing to courageously journal on how these beliefs continue to rule your life?&nbsp; How does your naturally thin woman&#39;s brain view these events?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep asking yourself, am I connecting with others? Would I still be eating if I were having a great conversation with someone at this party? Am I using food to hide my social discomfort?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If food is THE main event, then you must have a strategy to deal with triggers that will arise during the event. For example, when on vacation, make plans to take breaks, get out and see the sights, walk\/ride a bike, get to know your destination.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know that during Phase 1 of the rewiring, for women with &quot;severe&quot; YFAS scores, eating with others at a table with large, open platters can be challenging! &nbsp;Plan on taking 2 breaths in between bites if you catch yourself reverting to your old patterns.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your brain still believes that overeating is a pleasure. That makes it extremely difficult to say &quot;I&#39;m satisfied&quot; when there is tasty food right by you, ESPECIALLY when everyone else appears to be enjoying it. Remember that addicts get triggered by just the sight of other addicts indulging in their drug. If your addiction level is high, the mere sight of food will make you salivate as the food fantasies generate dopamine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of sitting at a table full of food, walk around and, again, keep asking yourself, &quot;What are the naturally thin people doing at this party?&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;ll bet you they are primarily dancing or admiring the d&eacute;cor or the view. When food is the most interesting thing to do at a party, it&#39;s time to ... go for a walk. ;-)<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prep for Eating with Family<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be aware that at the early stages of your rewiring, eating &quot;family style&quot; can be challenging! &nbsp;Your brain still believes that overeating is a pleasure. It makes it extremely difficult to say &quot;I&#39;m satisfied&quot; when there is tasty food right by you, ESPECIALLY when everyone else appears to be enjoying it. Remember that addicts get triggered by just the sight of other addicts indulging in their drug. If your addiction level is high, the mere sight of food will make you salivate as the food fantasies generate dopamine. Don&#39;t feel ashamed to ask for support. Sitting next to food, even when you already know that you are physically full, will be challenging.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there are family tensions, the peacekeepers in the family typically attempt to hide behind their food. If you are working on your communication skills, you might not be able to express your emotions, and again you may cope by overeating, as that is how we all cope with situations we lack the skills to address.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prep for Eating with Friends<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most restaurant meals last from 90 to 180 minutes. Think about it: three to six times longer than when you eat a meal mindfully by yourself. For most of my adult life I didn&#39;t have the awareness, let alone the courage, to be truthful with myself and admit that I was not engaged. I also did not take responsibility to <em>be<\/em> engaging and to bring interesting topics to the social gathering. When food is the most interesting part of the social gathering, you will be challenged not to overeat. The longer you sit at the table, the more likely you will be to overeat.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you experience that the food has a magnetic pull, ask yourself, &quot;If I were having an interesting conversation, would I still be feeling overwhelmed by the desire to overeat?&quot; Don&#39;t place all of the responsibility of that interesting conversation on others. Can you bring at least three compelling topics that will keep you interested and emotionally engaged?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most human beings model others when eating in groups. Pace yourself with the <em>lightest<\/em> eater of the group.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When eating socially, it is more important than ever that you breathe between bites. Instead of just one breath between bites, take two or three.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are overwhelmed by brain hunger, order something like string beans or edamame, and mindfully chew on those.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Meals on a Vacation<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, is this a bona fide vacation?&nbsp;A time to restore&nbsp;yourself, nurture your soul and experience joy?&nbsp;Or, is it a family vacation?&nbsp;Will it help you revisit funny or loving memories and rekindle meaningful connections?&nbsp;Will you feel nurtured, accepted and understood by those that you share a profound bond with?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is a family vacation, and you are lucky to have a family where you truly feel restored, you&#39;ve won the family lottery. For those for whom &quot;family vacations&quot; need to be followed by psychological therapy, you must understand that you might be subjecting yourself to a roller coaster of emotions that could feel like a machine gun of triggers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awareness is the key. Can you name the memories, behaviors, and feelings that trigger &quot;brain hunger&quot; when you interact with your family?&nbsp;Do you have any clue as to the life skill that would help you effectively deal with these triggers?&nbsp;If not, would you like help addressing these triggers?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is food THE main event of the vacation?&nbsp;Or the means to take breaks?&nbsp;If it is the main event, what can YOU do to make your vacation about new experiences, feeling joy, or rejuvenating and restoring yourself?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get to know your destination before you arrive! Take games that you can share with others, plan activities off the beaten path, and identify locations to take breaks that are not around food or in restaurants.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When eating with others, name the instances when &quot;I&#39;m not engaged&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m upset&quot; or &quot;I&#39;d rather be doing something else.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these will trigger brain hunger.

NO! NO! to the brain hunger or by distracting yourself with another behavior. In contrast, rewiring occurs when you can compassionately observe your brain hunger without feeling anxious or compelled to indulge it. This is radically different from will-power. You don&#39;t attempt to flee from the compulsion to overeat; you thoughtfully observe it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A common mindfulness practice is one where you consistently, but compassionately, return your focus to your breathing. The ability to recognize when you&#39;ve lost focus on your breath and to compassionately bring it back is how you build mindfulness. Once you develop that mindfulness muscle, you then have the ability to observe brain hunger without being overwhelmed by it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This mindfulness is developed by consistent repetition over a period of time, like building a bicep that is able to lift a heavy weight. Your goal is to sustain 20 minutes of mindfulness per day by the end of Phase 2. We recommend beginning with 5 minutes\/day and increasing the duration organically. This strategy will allow you to arrive at 10 minutes per day by the end of Phase 1, after 21 days of practice. During Phase 2, you keep building until, after 42 days of consecutive practice, you will have arrived at your goal of 20 minutes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These twenty minutes of mindfulness can be achieved via a combination of mindful moments and\/or mindfulness practice. A mindful moment is one where you take at least 15 seconds and focus on slow, soothing breaths, scan your body, and where you are present to your surroundings; noticing something different in the environment is a good indication of mindfulness. Mindful moments are recommended every 15 minutes, as they are not only helpful to build up the mindfulness muscle, but they also help you keep stress levels within a healthy range throughout the day. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples of mindfulness practice are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Meditation&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Focused running&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Quilting<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Swimming&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Any activity where you can quiet the verbal center of your brain and maintain internal silence can be part of your mindfulness practice.

At the start of the TWB program, it&rsquo;s likely that you are wired to experience brain hunger when what you really need is relaxation, support, dopamine, or something other than the bleak perspective you are projecting in your head. Unmet emotional needs trigger an internal programming that goes something like this:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>When you need a <em>break<\/em>, the overeating wiring convinces you that you need a <em>snack<\/em>, which gets your body out of the chair.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>When you need to relax, the overeating wiring activates the desire to eat something to weigh your body down. Heavy food will stop you from continuing to push yourself beyond your physical limits; it may be the only time that you relax.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>When you need companionship and\/or nurturing, you immediately begin craving comfort foods.\u0094&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>When you are feeling lonely, &ldquo;WAIT, Mr. Haagen Dazs is available to be your date.&rdquo;<\/li>\r\n\t<li>When there is nothing entertaining to watch, hey, four slices of pizza will fix that in a New York minute!<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you are learning to use brain hunger as the barometer that lets you know that your body either needs dopamine (in the form of aerobics, laughter, meditation, or your personal dopamine source) or perhaps oxytocin (in the form of human connection, camaraderie, understanding, or nurturing). &nbsp;Alternatively, you might need to stop manufacturing cortisol, which is experienced as a painful projection of a bleak and unbearable future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are thousands of books on emotional eating. The TWB program focuses on identifying the triggers that are activating your addictive response and helping you to understand why those emotional needs are now associated with food. &nbsp;Research has identified nine life skills that are present in individuals who successfully overcome addictive behaviors.
